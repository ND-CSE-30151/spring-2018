    "### Another pumping lemma\n",
    "\n",
    "The pumping lemma for context-free languages is a little more complicated than the pumping lemma for regular languages (even though it actually predates it). \n",
    "\n",
    "From an \"outside\" point of view, the basic difference is that the pumping causes _two_ pieces of the string to be repeated instead of just one. Also, whereas in the regular pumping lemma, the repeated piece had to be near the beginning of the string, here, the two pieces have to be near each other but can occur anywhere in the string. Other than that, writing proofs using the context-free pumping lemma is the same as using the regular pumping lemma.\n",
    "\n",
    "From an \"inside\" point of view, the argument is similar to the regular pumping lemma, but goes along the _longest path of the tree_ instead of the string. You pick a string $s$ that is long enough to guarantee that the parse tree for $s$ has a repeated nonterminal along its longest path. Choose the lowest such loop. Then, you go around that loop multiple times to generate new strings. These strings have _two_ pieces of $s$ repeated. Or, you go around the loop zero times, yielding a string with two pieces of $s$ removed. You have to show that the new string does not belong to the language. Therefore the grammar can't generate the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the details of the proof are a lot more complicated than the details of the regular pumping lemma. So we'll start by presenting the argument as a dialogue between Alice and Bill, but some of Alice's reasoning will be unexplained at first."

    "### The pumping length\n",

    "Recall that in the regular pumping lemma, the pumping length $p$ was just the number of states in the DFA. Thus $p$ symbols was enough to ensure that the DFA went through a loop, and the loop had to occur within the first $p$ symbols. Now, we want to know how many terminals is long enough to ensure that the CFG goes through a loop.\n",

    "Then it's easy to see that the largest possible tree with branching factor $b$ and height $h$ has $b^h$ leaves. So if we set $p = b^{|V|+1}$, then even the biggest tree of height $|V|$ couldn't have that many leaves, so the tree must have height at least $|V|+1$. (As the book points out, $p=b^{|V|}+1$ would have been enough, but we overshoot for a reason that will hopefully be clear in a moment.) That means that the longest path must have at least $|V|+1$ nonterminals and a terminal. So there must be a repeated nonterminal (a \"loop\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "We can say more. If we choose the lowest such loop, we know that it must occur within a subtree of height at most $|V|+1$, which means this subtree must have at most $b^{|V|+1}$ leaves. Conveniently, that's what we set $p$ to -- so we can make the tidy statement that if the tree has at least $p$ leaves, there must be a loop, and the loop must occur within a subtree with at most $p$ leaves."
