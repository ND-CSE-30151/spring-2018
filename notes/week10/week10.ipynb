    "### The halting problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The first example is the halting problem. In many textbooks (and the poem \"Scooping the Loop Snooper\"), the halting problem is actually the prototypical undecidable language, but Sipser does things a little differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The proof is not difficult but it has a weird feel to it. The first thing that you have to remember is that the direction of the reduction is the opposite of what most people intuitively think of first. If you want to show that the halting problem is undecidable, you do _not_ reduce the halting problem to $A_{\\mathsf{TM}}$. You assume that the halting problem _is_ decidable, then show via a reduction from $A_{\\mathsf{TM}}$ to the halting problem that $A_{\\mathsf{TM}}$ would also be decidable, which is a contradiction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that we designed $U$, a universal TM, that _recognizes_ $A_{\\mathsf{TM}}$, but we showed that we cannot design a TM $S$, a \"universal decider,\" that _decides_ $A_{\\mathsf{TM}}$. Practically, the sticking point is that on input $\\langle M, w\\rangle$, if $M$ loops on $w$, we have no way to detect it so that we can reject. Enter $R$, a hypothetical TM that decides the halting problem $\\mathit{HALT}_{\\mathsf{TM}}$. If we had such a machine, then designing $S$ would be easy: use $R$ to check for looping. if a loop is detected, reject; if no loop is detected, we can safely simulate $M$ and return what it returns. But last time we showed (by diagonalization) that $S$ does not exist. Therefore, $R$ cannot exist either."

    "\n",
    "In general, to show that some problem P is undecidable, you assume that P is decidable by some TM $R$ and use that to implement a universal decider $S$. That implementation usually has three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert an input to $S$ (a pair $\\langle M, w\\rangle$) into an instance of P.\n",
    "2. Run $R$ on the converted instance.\n",
    "3. Interpret the result of $R$ to decide whether $M$ accepts $w$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the reduction from $A_{\\textsf{TM}}$ to the halting problem, step 1 was trivial: $\\langle M, w \\rangle$ maps to itself. But in other cases, this step may be more complicated. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's show that it is undecidable whether a given Python program $P$ writes to the filesystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that this is decidable. That is, there exists a TM $R$ that accepts $\\langle P\\rangle$ if and only if $P$ would write to the filesystem. Let's call it the \"write-detector.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to build a universal decider $S$ that somehow uses the write-detector $R$ to decide $A_{\\mathsf{TM}}$. We can't possibly feed $\\langle M, w\\rangle$ to $R$ because $R$ wants a Python program. So we need to convert $M$ and $w$ into a Python program. We assume a Python function `simulate` that simulates a TM and returns `True` for accept or `False` for reject; this function can also potentially loop. It should be obvious that such a function exists, although it's long enough that we don't bother to write it out.\n",

    "3. If $R$ detected a write, then _accept_.\n",
    "4. Otherwise, _reject_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program $P$ acts as an \"adapter\" between the property we need to detect ($M$ accepting $w$) and the property that we can detect ($P$ writing to the filesystem).\n",
    "\n",
    "To see that $S$ is a universal decider, let's walk through the possible cases:\n",
    "- If $M$ accepts $w$, then $P$ would wipe out your files. $R$ detects this, and so $S$ accepts.\n",
    "- If $M$ rejects $w$, then $P$ does not wipe out your files. $R$ does not detect any writes, and so $S$ rejects.\n",
    "- Similarly, if $M$ loops on $w$, then $P$ would run forever but would not wipe out your files. $R$ does not detect any writes, and so $S$ rejects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus $S$ decides $A_{\\mathsf{TM}}$ as desired, which is a contradiction. We conclude that it's undecidable whether a given Python program writes to the filesystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, when you're trying to prove that detecting property P is undecidable, this \"adapter\" usually has to do the following things:\n",
    "- Simulate $M$ on $w$.\n",
    "- If $M$ accepts, then exhibit property P.\n",
